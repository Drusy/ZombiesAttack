ZombiesAttack
=============


> Simulation project of engineering school (ISIMA).


### Goal
In this C++/Qt program, we try to show the consequencies of a possible zombies invasion.
It's a agent-based simulation in which population protected by hunters try to survice against zombies.

This funny application of the C++ simualtion programming is a good way to work with severals patterns and smart agents oriented objects.
